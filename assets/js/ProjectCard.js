        <p>As the creator of this portfolio website, I started by customizing a React.js template to fit my style and ideas. The main attraction is the "first page" where I designed a cool CI/CD terminal animation from scratch, showing off my creativity and tech skills.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Then, I customized the rest of the website to include my projects, education, experience, and other info. I played around with layouts, added dynamic features, and made sure everything flowed well for the users.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Once I finished building it, I put the website up on GitHub Pages so anyone could check it out. This meant setting up the hosting and making sure it ran smoothly for everyone who visited.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>To sum up, I came up with, built, and launched this portfolio website using a React.js template as my starting point. The special CI/CD terminal animation and all the content reflect who I am and what I can do, giving visitors a glimpse of my skills and personality.</p>
